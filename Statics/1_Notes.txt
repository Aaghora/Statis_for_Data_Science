1) Descriptive statistics: These methods are used to summarize and describe the characteristics of a dataset. 
The goal of descriptive statistics is to provide a clear and concise summary of a dataset that allows us to understand the main features of the data.
Examples include measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and measures of spread (range, variance, standard deviation).
Descriptive statistics play an important role in data exploration and can help identify patterns, outliers, and anomalies in 
the data that can guide further analysis and modeling.



2) Inferential statistics: These methods are used to make predictions or draw conclusions from data. 
Examples include hypothesis testing and estimation.

3) Linear regression: This method is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
 It is commonly used in predictive modeling.

4) Logistic regression: This method is used to model the relationship between a binary dependent variable and one or more independent variables. 
It is commonly used in classification tasks.

5) Decision Trees: This method is a type of supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. 
It builds a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences.

6) Clustering: This method is used to group similar observations together. The most common type of clustering is k-means clustering, 
which involves dividing a dataset into k clusters based on similarity.

7) Time series analysis: This method is used to understand and make predictions about data that varies over time. Techniques include 
moving averages, exponential smoothing, and ARIMA modeling.

8) Bayesian statistics: This method is a type of statistical inference that is based on Bayes' theorem, which is used to update 
the probability of an event based on new information.

9) Monte Carlo methods: These methods use random sampling to solve mathematical problems. They are often used in simulations and optimization.

10) Survival analysis: This method is used to analyze time-to-event data, such as time until failure or time until a particular event occurs.
